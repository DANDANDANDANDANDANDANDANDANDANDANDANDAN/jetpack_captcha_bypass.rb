On a recent engagement I came across a 'Jetpack' CAPTCHA on a WordPress login portal that demanded I 'prove my humanity' by adding two numbers together.

Suffice to say, it's broken.

This script will take a URL (for the affected login portal), a target (username) and a password dictionary, then prove your humanity for you.

Requires the 'Faraday' and 'Nokogiri' Gems.
